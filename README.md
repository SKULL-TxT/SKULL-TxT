- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m SKULL-TxT, I'm a content creator on YouTube, I mod the game Free Fire and other games too
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learn a new type of mod that is very rare to do in Free Fire. In Free Fire there are 2 types of Skin
1 - Skin made with Monobehavior script
2 - Skin made with Mesh (3D object like FBx,Obj...)
the skins made with Monobehavior I can modify with another skin in the game, but I want to learn how to put another model in the game (Example = I WANT TO PUT CJ from GTA in SOME SKIN in the GAME) but I believe that modifying a monobehavior from scratch with a skin that doesn't exist in the game is very difficult!
Then there is the second option of replacing a Free Fire skin model with another model from outside the game, using skins made with mesh (3D obj). I have some theories on how to do this.
My first theory and the one that makes the most sense on how to do this is to export the Game model with Bones, skinMeshRender, Avatar and AnimationControler, then place it in the new model, create Assets, open it with Assets-Bundle-Extractor and enter the necessary Scripts, Anyway, I will pay anyone who helps me to do this.
